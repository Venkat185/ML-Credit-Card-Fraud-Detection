## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains transaction data labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new transactions.

## Dataset

Source: A credit card transaction dataset.

Data Format: CSV file containing transaction details.

## Features:

Numerical features representing transaction details.

Labels indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Technologies Used

Programming Languages & Libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

Installation & Setup

## Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd credit-card-fraud-detection

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

## Usage

Data Loading: Read transaction data from a CSV file.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends using matplotlib and seaborn.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and data balancing.

Model Training: Train machine learning models to classify transactions.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results

The trained model identifies fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

Feature importance analysis provides insights into key transaction factors contributing to fraud detection.
